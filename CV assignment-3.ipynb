    "ans:Double the number of filters after each stride-2 conv is a common practice in deep learning. This is because it helps the model learn more complex features at each layer and helps reduce the dimensionality of the input. By doubling the number of filters, the model can more effectively detect features across the entire image. Additionally, doubling the number of filters helps to reduce the total number of parameters in the model, which can reduce the risk of overfitting."
